This is a test monorepo with the following intentions:

- [x] monorepo workspace managed by `pnpm`
- [x] versioning by `changesets`
  - [x] including version bump PRs by GitHub actions
  - [x] including publishing to GitHub npm registry by GitHub actions
- [x] git hooks by `husky`
- [x] linting by...
- [x] tasks by `turborepo`?
- [x] support packages written in `ts` and `js`
